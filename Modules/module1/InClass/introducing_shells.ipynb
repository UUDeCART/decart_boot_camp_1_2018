    "All modern computers run **operating systems** that control how a user (and programs) interact with the underlying hardware. A nice overview of operating systems is available [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system) on Wikipedia.\n",

    "Although graphical user interfaces (GUIs) have been the primary interface for most users using a computer since the mid-1990s, both Windows and UNIX-variants come with programs called **shells** that allow the user to interact with the operating system by typing commands in the shell: command line interfaces (CLI). In some disciplines, such as bioinformatics, the vast majority of tools are run from the command line.\n",

    "There are two commonly used operating systems: \n",

    "1. Microsoft Windows (and its variants)\n",
    "1. UNIX (and its variants, including Linux). \n",

    "A shell is a user environment with a collection of programs available to the user. These programs allow the user to move around in the file system; create, modify, and delete files and directories; examine content of files; run other programs; etc. Within UNIX/Linux there are a number of different shells (see [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_command_shells#General_characteristics) table for some examples). We will be working with the [bash shell](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/).\n",
