For example, a running process can query the value of the TEMP environment variable to discover a suitable location to store temporary files, or the HOME or USERPROFILE variable to find the directory structure owned by the user running the process.\n",
    "\n",
    ">They were introduced in their modern form in 1979 with Version 7 Unix, so are included in all Unix operating system flavors and variants from that point onward including Linux and OS X. From PC DOS 2.0 in 1982, all succeeding Microsoft operating systems including Microsoft Windows, and OS/2 also have included them as a feature, although with somewhat different syntax, usage and standard variable names.

    "For ``PATH`` what we see is a colon separated list of directories. If I want to run an executable program, for example python, the way ``PATH`` is used is the computer looks in the first directory in ``PATH`` for an executable named ``python``. If it finds it, the program ``python`` in that directory is executed. If it is not found, then it goes to the next directory in ``PATH`` and so on. If all of ``PATH`` is searched and no matching executable is found, you will get an error message: \"CMD: command not found\". I can use the Unix command ``which`` to tell me where in the ``PATH`` a particular program was found. Here are some examples.  "
