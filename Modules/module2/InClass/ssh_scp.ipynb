    "SSH stands for **s**ecure **tsh**ll. ssh is a protocol that was developed in the 1990s to replace older remote connection protocols like [``telnet``](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telnet). ``ssh`` uses [public key encryption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telnet) to encrypt the transmissions across the connection. This is important when passwords are being passed for authentication. ``telnet`` and ``ftp`` do not use encryption, so passwords are being passed across the network as free text, which can be easily intercepted. There is now a secure ftp (``sftp``) that encrypts the communication. \n",
    "\n",
    "We use ``ssh`` to connect to a remote computer. For example, I frequently connect from my laptop to a workstation in my office. Another important application would be connecting to a server in the cloud, for example a server you have setup with [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/free/?sc_channel=PS&sc_campaign=acquisition_US&sc_publisher=google&sc_medium=cloud_computing_b&sc_content=aws_url_e_control_q32016&sc_detail=amazon.%20web%20services&sc_category=cloud_computing&sc_segment=188908164667&sc_matchtype=e&sc_country=US&s_kwcid=AL!4422!3!188908164667!e!!g!!amazon.%20web%20services&ef_id=WVKaPAAAAfUJDrqI:20170627174740:s). \n",
