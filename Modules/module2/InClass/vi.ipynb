    "## Why Do I need to Learn How to Use a Text Editor?\n",
    "\n",
    "We are all used to working in graphical computing environments where we have multiple windows that we can interact with using a mouse or a track pad, in addition to our keyboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, in scientific computing, we often need to connect remotely to another computer. Frequently in these circumstances we will connect in a way that we do not have a graphical environment that recognizes our mouse (or equivalent), yet we will still need to edit files.\n",
    "\n",
    "The bash terminals that we use in this Jupyter environment is an example of a non-graphical connection.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What Text Editors are Available To Use?\n",
    "\n",
    "Unix/Linux comes with a number of non-graphical text editors including \n",
    "* [``nano``](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_nano)\n",
    "* [``emacs``](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emacs)\n",
    "* [``vi`` (actually ``vim`` \"**vi** i**m**proved\")](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vi). \n",
    "\n",
    "``nano`` is the newest of the three editors. ``emacs`` and ``vi`` are among the oldest programs in use in computing. There is almost a religious divide between people who use ``emacs`` and people who use ``vi``. We will spend a little bit of time learning how to use ``vim``. Our choice of ``vim`` is motivated by the fact that \n",
    "1. it is the default editor and Linux (and thus will likely come up when we forget to create a commit message with git (future lesson))\n",
    "1. most of the people preparing these lectures prefer vim to emacs.\n",

    "1. We will be able to navigate the document using basic keyboard commands\n",

    "* ``b``: move backwards to the previous word\n",
    "* ``i``: enter edit mode before the current character\n",
    "* ``a``: enter edit mode after the current character\n",
    "* ``I``: enter edit mode at the beginning of the current line\n",
    "* ``A``: enter edit mode at the end of the current line\n",
